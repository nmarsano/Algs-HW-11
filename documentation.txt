This algorithm first takes k block descriptions (3 dimensions) and creates an array of all possible block configurations (3k total).
It then sorts that array in order of biggest base-area to smallest base-area. Two arrays then get initialized of size 3k, one to store
the tallest possible tower heights with that block (each cell in the array represents a block) as the top block, and the other to store
strings of the blocks actually used to calculate the heights in the other array in order to create the output text file.
Then, 

The run time for this algorithm is Theta(n^2) (as seen in the double for-loop at the bottom of the program file where the DPTable gets
filled).
